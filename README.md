# Lessons Learnt
___
## Introduction
In this repository you will find several projects that did not produce the expected results. This is where I learnt valuable lessons on “doing” data science. This is where I tried to understand how various types of regression worked or did not work. They are all failures,  but I keep them as a reminder of what went wrong and why. Some projects shown here are sometimes incomplete as I realised it was not going to work

In this repository I also keep templates which are based on sound lessons that I found on the Internet. Most times I followed the lesson sometimes using a different dataset other times same dataset. I used these examples to learn how to do a particular project correctly and understand the process. These templates are always referenced with the source website
